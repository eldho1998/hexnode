# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# CHALLENGES

### Hexnode clone teaches me a lot. Major challenge is the development of responsive CSS. Also major feature of the dotted line flow in the WHY HEXNODE Section is a big challenge for me. And dropped it!

### In the Customer Section the slide is not working with mouse. But working on keyboard by moving left,right arrow keys!

### Didn't get the real colourful images and exact PNG images from the Hexnode Website. (Black & White).
